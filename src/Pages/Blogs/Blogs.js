            <p>14.1 How will you improve the performance of a React Application?</p>
            <p>14.2 What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?(5-7)(line 2.max 10 line).</p>
            <p>  14.3 How does prototypical inheritance work in JavaScript?</p>
            <p> 14.4 Why you do not set the state directly in React.For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts.</p>
            <p>  14.5 You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?</p>
            <p>14.6 What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?</p>
